# Four-In-A-Line

 This game is a simple game based on the concept from "Connect Four". \n
	This game allows a user to play in two different modes: a single player mode against computer’s artificial intelligence and a two players mode in a turn basis. \n
 I wrote Form1.cs, Form2.cs, Form3.cs and Form4.cs \n
