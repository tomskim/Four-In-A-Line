# Four In A Line
 Language used: C# .NET

 This game is a simple game based on the concept from "Connect Four".

	This game allows a user to play in two different modes: 

  -> a single player mode against computer’s artificial intelligence
  
  -> a two players mode in a turn basis. 

 I contributed to Form1.cs, Form2.cs, Form3.cs, Form4.cs and their designs.
